At first, It was just like 

Don't eva feel like you gotta yk act a certain way or do something fer my sake. But, I also feel insecure when sometimes you're maybe not responsive to/reciprocating somethin'. I thought about why I was yk feelin' what ah feel, cuz i thought i was bein' ridiculous, cuz why would ah care. I think that insecurity comes from me being vulnerable and yk open in the ways i know how, and then since people r different and ya might not approach things the same way, i didn't really see anything happening on your end, which was scary cuz i got a history of me bein' real honest to people and them usin it as a weapon against me lolz. But when ah thought about it, So basically, my resolution is that ill stop thinking so hard, cuz yk, i trust ya and i. Yeah. 


If ah was acting weird before, basically, ah think that ah was scared or something of becomin' yk a nuisance who's kinda just something annoyin ya can't detach, since yk some things ah say n' do are, secondarily, unconscious ways of becomin' yk more vulnerable n' open. Sah when maybe i wasn't getting the same methods of whatever in return, i was like :0 somethin's wrong and ah backtracked, cuz normally if im open to someone and they don't return it, i end up like yk dying or gettin pushed away. And yk, that would kinda suck, cuz if ya didn't know, i kinda like you around. So ah had this weird feeling of dread or something, idk. So i also didn't know how to yk talk about this, cuz im bad at talkin', but after much data analysis, i've come to the conclusion that maybe im kinda stupid, cuz you've bin really yk real n' open ta me ah think, and it doesn't really hafta be yk exactly the same ways ah do things. And plus, obviously if I'm eva tryin' to push ya do do stuff it's a lil messed up. So mah resolution is to stop thinking so much and just yk, enjoy ur mom.
